Feature: The solution must use ajax
	In order for the application to feel snappy the client/server
	interaction should be in place updates rather than full page
	reloads.

	# This feature is written in Gherkin for the purpose of documenting
	# the client's desires but won't actually be tested at this time.
	# It probably could be tested in some fashion but I'm not going to
	# right now.
	# TODO: prove that ajax is in use in some meaningful way
	# You could for example write your performance limits in Gherkin
